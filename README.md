3. My name is Jonathon Stillson. I have degrees in Electronics Engineering Technology and Computer Science. I served 12 years in the United States Coast Guard as an electronics technician. I have had an obsession with technology since my childhood. My grandparents worked for IBM and other computing companies and I can recall my Grandfather teaching me the CD\ command so I could play games on the home computer when I was four and I grew up in the 90s where the rate of technological innovation always had me curious for “what they would come up with next”. I was raised a Coast Guard brat, my Stepfather also having been an electronics technician in the Coast Guard. I used to watch him repair home electronics such as televisions, stereos, and VCRs. Eventually while we lived in a small town in Minnesota my parents opened a store called Mr. VCR where electronics were repaired, household electronics and media were sold, and video tapes were rented. So my upbringing was always rooted in technology and problem solving. 

As a technician in the Coast Guard I learned my trade and how to operate within a complex professional environment. As years went by I always extended my contract or reenlisted because I hadn’t determined what else I would do. But the organization always felt like a means and not an end to me. The organization moved me to all corners of the country as a child and as an adult and helped me to realize that my drive is innovative problem solving and developing solutions and gave me the means to become educated in skills that would help me pursue that passion from an engineering perspective. The inertial forces of organizations, established standards or practices, and societal norms are what inspired me to transition from electronics to computer science. I’m incredibly interested in the ways which software and hardware can be designed to innovate. Ultimately my transition to computer science or tech is a strong desire to engage with creating solutions rather than endeavoring to maintain the implementation of the solutions. 

4. What excites me most is that to me computers and electronics feel like a canvas which you can paint anything on and realize real world effects.
